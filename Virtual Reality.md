# Understanding Virtual Reality.

VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as *gaming* and *3D* cinema.

Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990s. 

In **robotics** , virtual reality has been used to control robots in telepresence and telerobotic systems.
The technology is useful in robotics development too.

The technology is useful in robotics development such as in experiments that investigate how robots—through virtual articulations—can be applied as an intuitive human interface.

For instance, researchers can simulate how robots are remotely controlled in different environments such as in space.
Here, virtual reality not only offers insights into the manipulation and locomotion of robotic technology but also shows opportunities for inspection.

In *social sciences and psychology* , virtual reality offers a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment.

It can be used as a form of *therapeutic intervention* .

For instance, there is the case of the virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post **traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias** .

Surgery training can be done through virtual reality.

With the supervision of experts to provide feedback, simulated VR surgical environment provide effective and repeatable training at a low cost, allowing trainees to recognize and amend errors as they occur.

Virtual reality has been used in rehabilitation since the 2000s.

Despite numerous studies conducted, good quality evidence of its efficacy compared to other rehabilitation methods without sophisticated and expensive equipment is lacking for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

A 2018 review on the effectiveness of mirror therapy by virtual reality and robotics for any type of pathology concluded in a similar way.
VR can simulate real workspaces for workplace occupational safety and health purposes, educational purposes, and training purposes.

It can be used to provide learners with a virtual environment where they can develop their skills without the real-world consequences of failing.
It has been used and studied in *primary education,military,astronaut training,flight simulators,driver training and bridge inspection* .
Supplementing military training with virtual training environments has been claimed to offer avenues of realism in *military and healthcare training while minimizing cost* .

It also has been claimed to reduce military training costs by minimizing the amounts of ammunition expended during training periods.
There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality.

**Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including** :

Seizures developmental issues in children, trip-and-fall and collision warnings,discomfort, repetitive stress injury and interference with medical devices.

Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. 

As many as one in 4000 people may experience these symptoms, and they are more common among people under the age of 20, which is part of why most VR headsets advise against children using VR headsets. 

Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment.

While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.

The simplest form of virtual reality is a *3-D image** that can be explored interactively at a personal computer, usually by manipulating keys or the mouse so that the content of the image moves in some direction or zooms in or out.
More sophisticated efforts involve such approaches as wrap-around display screens, actual rooms augmented with wearable computers, and haptics devices that let you feel the display images.
*Virtual reality can be divided into* :
The simulation of a real environment for training and education.
The development of an imagined environment for a game or interactive story.

# Cinema:

Films produced for VR permit the audience to view a 360-degree environment.

This can involve the use of VR cameras to produce films and series that are interactive in VR.

The 2016 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Sergey Karjakin, was promoted as "the first in any sport to be broadcast in 360-degree virtual reality.

" However, a VR telecast featuring Oklahoma hosting Ohio State, took place September 17, 2016."

The telecasts (which used roughly 180 degrees of rotation, not the 360 required for full VR) were made available through paid smartphone apps and head-mounted displays.

Since 2015, virtual reality has been installed onto a number of roller coasters and theme parks.

The Void is a virtual reality theme park in Pleasant Grove, Utah that has attractions where, by using virtual reality, AR and customized mechanical rooms, an illusion of tangible reality is created by the use of multiple senses.

# Music and concerts :

VR can allow individuals to attend concerts without actually being there.

 The experience of VR concerts can feel passive with the lack of interaction between the user and the performers and audience, but it can be enhanced using feedback from user's heartbeat rates and brainwaves.
 
 Virtual reality can also be used for other forms of music, such as *music videos* and *music visualization* or *visual music* .
 
 # Gaming :

 To begin with, VR provides players with an entirely new and improved gaming experience. 
 When you wear a VR headset, such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or PlayStation VR, you become absorbed by your personal gaming world.
 Being in the game instead of merely playing it changes the whole experience by creating a connection between the player and the game.
